        What is that diverges from the traditionnal system, and what is, in terms of code, that allows
        this conceptual shift to happen?

    </br>
</br>

    <b>Intuitions: </b>
    </br>

        One can change a script, but once a P2P system of <b>mutual validation</b> requirements is enabled, the script
        becomes secondary. It is about the running program and the autonomy of the system.
        Blockchain is not about a code, its about an autonomous process the code has started.
        Blockchain is hence first about the idea of autonomous system as opposed to a man-managed 
        bureaucracy.

        We all know how the simple idea of bureaucracy is repulsive. This is a simple reason enough to make us
        bnelieve in the inexorable development of blockchains as the new engine of structures that make an intense 
        usage of contracts, lawyers, etc.

    </br>
        Now, considering this fundamental idea of autonomy as opposed to man-managed organizations (bureaucracies),
        the question is -  from a technical standpoint - how does the interface between the autonomous system and humans present itself?

    </br>
    </br>

    <h3>Man-managed organizations versus self-adjusting system: </h3>

    </br>
       The <b> Dynamic difficulty and mine rate </b> participate to the self-adjusting nature of the system

    </br>
    </br>

    <h4>The reasons of myh own personnal interests regarding blockchain: </h4>
    <ul style="margin-inline-start: 35px;">
        <li> Definitely, the fact that a new system can revolutionize such a fundamental societal element as 
            bureaucracy fascinates me the most.</li>
        <li> Another fascinating point - by anticipation - is that programmers would be kind of societal architects.
            Even more than today.
            While blockchains could be the new engine of bureaucracy, and omnipresent, they would be black-boxes for the 
            average citizen. It would reinforce the <b> cast of experts </b> effect. </br>
            This movement also goes hand in hand with the automatisation movement, since many control and validation jobs could disapear in 
            bureaucracy.
        </li>

        <li> It has been many years that I think that the private sector attracks the most talented people.
            For two reasons mainly:
