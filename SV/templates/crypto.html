        </br>

        
        What is that diverges from the traditionnal system, and what is, in terms of code, that allows
        this conceptual shift to happen

    </br>

        Intuitions:

        One can change a script, but once a p2p system of <b>mutual validation</b> requirements is enabled, the sscript
        becomes secondary. It is about the running program and the autonomy of the system.
        Blockchain is not about a code, its about an autonomous process the code has started.
        Blockchain is hence first about the idea of autonomou system as opposed to a man-managed 
        bureaucracy.

        We all know how the simple idea of bureaucracy is repulsive. This is a simple reason enough to make us
        bnelieve in the inexorable development of blockchains the new engine of structures that make an intense 
        usage of contracts, lawyers, etc.

    </br>

        Now, considering this fundamental idea of autonomy as opposed to man-managed organizations (bureaucracies),
        the question is -  from a technical standpoint - how does the interface between the autonomous system and humans present itself?
